## Charmed PostgreSQL Documentation
The Charmed PostgreSQL Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [PostgreSQL Database Management System](https://www.postgresql.org/). It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/).

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

The Charmed PostgreSQL operator comes in two flavours to deploy and operate PostgreSQL on [physical/virtual machines](https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-operator) and [Kubernetes](https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-k8s-operator). Both offer features such as replication, TLS, password rotation, and easy to use integration with applications. The Charmed PostgreSQL Operator meets the need of deploying PostgreSQL in a structured and consistent manner while allowing the user flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of PostgreSQL in production at scale in a reliable way.
