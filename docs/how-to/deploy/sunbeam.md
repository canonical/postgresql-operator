# How to deploy on Sunbeam

> **Duration** : Up to 60 minutes depending on internet download speed.

This guide goes through the steps for setting up Sunbeam and deploying Charmed PostgreSQL. 

## Prerequisites
* A physical or virtual machine running Ubuntu 22.04+
  * If you'd like to follow this guide in an isolated test environment, you can use [Multipass](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/multipass/en/latest/).
* Hardware requirements depend on planned deployment size.
  * Recommended: 8 CPU cores, 32GB RAM, 100GB of storage
  * Minimum: See the requirements listed in the [Sunbeam documentation][Single-node guided]

## Install and bootstrap Sunbeam
Follow the official OpenStack guide: [Single-node deployment][Single-node guided]. 

Pay attention to the `Caution` and `Note` sections - the `/etc/hosts` will require a [manual fqdn fix](https://github.com/canonical/multipass/issues/3277#issuecomment-2471434029).

## Enable OpenStack images auto-sync
Follow the official [Images Sync] guide to enable auto-sync and wait for the image `22.04` to be downloaded.

## Set up Juju inside an OpenStack bastion
Follow the MicroStack guide [Manage workloads with Juju] from the beginning, and stop after the section "Create a Juju controller". 

To summarize, the relevant sections are:
* Set up the bastion
* Install and configure the Juju client
* Create a Juju controller 

## Deploy Charmed PostgreSQL

Add a model if you don't have one already, and deploy a PostgreSQL cluster. Use the `-n` flag to specify number of units.
```text
juju add-model postgresql
juju deploy postgresql --channel 16/stable --base ubuntu@22.04 -n 3
```

Sample output of `juju status --watch 1s`:
```text
Model       Controller     Cloud/Region       Version  SLA          Timestamp
postgresql  my-controller  sunbeam/RegionOne  3.5.4    unsupported  19:42:44Z

```

## (Optional) Access the OpenStack dashboard 
Follow the official guide: [Accessing the OpenStack dashboard].

````{note}
When using a Multipass VM, you may need to manually route OpenStack IPs. For example:
```text
sudo ip route add 10.10.10.0/24 via 10.76.203.210 
```
where `10.76.203.210` is the IP of the Multipass VM and  `10.10.10.0` is the network returned by `sunbeam dashboard-url`. 
````

The image below is an example of the OpenStack dashboard view (bastion + juju controller + 3 `postgresql` nodes):
