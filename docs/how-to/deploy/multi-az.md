# Deploy on multiple availability zones (AZ) 

During the deployment to hardware/VMs, it is important to spread all the
database copies (Juju units) to different hardware servers,
or even better, to the different [availability zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_zone) (AZ). This will guarantee no shared service-critical components across the DB cluster (eliminate the case with all eggs in the same basket).

This guide will take you through deploying a PostgreSQL cluster on GCE using 3 available zones. All Juju units will be set up to sit in their dedicated zones only, which effectively guarantees database copy survival across all available AZs.

```{note}
This documentation assumes that your cloud supports and provides availability zones concepts. This is enabled by default on EC2/GCE and supported by LXD/MicroCloud.
```

## Set up GCE on Google Cloud

Let's deploy the [PostgreSQL Cluster on GKE (us-east4)](https://canonical-charmed-postgresql-k8s.readthedocs-hosted.com/16/how-to/deploy/gke/) using all 3 zones there (`us-east4-a`, `us-east4-b`, `us-east4-c`) and make sure all pods always sits in the dedicated zones only.

```{caution}
Creating the following GKE resources may cost you money - be sure to monitor your GCloud costs.
```

Log into Google Cloud and [bootstrap GCE on Google Cloud](/how-to/deploy/gce):
```text
gcloud auth login
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create sa-private-key.json  --iam-account=juju-gce-account@[your-gcloud-project-12345].iam.gserviceaccount.com
sudo mv sa-private-key.json /var/snap/juju/common/sa-private-key.json
sudo chmod a+r /var/snap/juju/common/sa-private-key.json

juju add-credential google
juju bootstrap google gce
juju add-model mymodel
```

## Deploy PostgreSQL with Juju zones constraints

Juju provides support for availability zones using [**constraints**](https://juju.is/docs/juju/constraint#zones).

The command below demonstrates how Juju automatically deploys Charmed PostgreSQL VM using Juju constraints:

```text
juju deploy postgresql --channel 16/stable -n 3 \
  --constraints zones=us-east1-b,us-east1-c,us-east1-d
```

After a successful deployment, `juju status` will show an active application:

```text
Model    Controller  Cloud/Region     Version    SLA          Timestamp
mymodel  gce         google/us-east1  3.5.4      unsupported  00:16:52+02:00

App         Version  Status  Scale  Charm       Channel    Rev  Exposed  Message

postgresql/2*  active    idle   2        34.138.167.85   5432/tcp  Primary

2        started  34.138.167.85  juju-e7c0db-2  ubuntu@22.04  us-east1-b  RUNNING
```

and each unit/vm will sit in the separate AZ out of the box:

```text
> gcloud compute instances list
NAME           ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE  PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
juju-a82dd9-0  us-east1-b  n1-highcpu-4               10.142.0.30  34.23.252.144  RUNNING  # Juju Controller

juju-e7c0db-1  us-east1-c  n2-highcpu-2               10.142.0.33  34.23.202.220  RUNNING  # postgresql/1
juju-e7c0db-0  us-east1-d  n2-highcpu-2               10.142.0.31  34.148.44.51   RUNNING  # postgresql/0
```

### Simulation: A node gets lost

Let's destroy a GCE node and recreate it using the same AZ:

```text
> gcloud compute instances delete juju-e7c0db-1 
No zone specified. Using zone [us-east1-c] for instance: [juju-e7c0db-1].
The following instances will be deleted. Any attached disks configured to be auto-deleted will be deleted unless they are attached to any other instances or the `--keep-disks` flag is given and specifies them for keeping. Deleting a disk is 
irreversible and any data on the disk will be lost.
 - [juju-e7c0db-1] in [us-east1-c]

Do you want to continue (Y/n)?  Y

Deleted [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/data-platform-testing-354909/zones/us-east1-c/instances/juju-e7c0db-1].
```

```text

2        started  34.138.167.85  juju-e7c0db-2  ubuntu@22.04  us-east1-b  RUNNING
```

Here we should remove the no-longer available `server/vm/GCE` node and add a new one. Juju will create it in the same AZ `us-east4-c`:

```text
> juju remove-unit postgresql/1 --force --no-wait
WARNING This command will perform the following actions:
will remove unit postgresql/1

Continue [y/N]? y
```

The command `juju status` shows the machines in a healthy state, but PostgreSQL HA recovery is necessary:
```text

mymodel  gce         google/us-east1  3.5.4      unsupported  00:30:09+02:00

2        started  34.138.167.85  juju-e7c0db-2  ubuntu@22.04  us-east1-b  RUNNING
```

Request Juju to add a new unit in the proper AZ:
```text
juju add-unit postgresql -n 1
```

Juju uses the right AZ where the node is missing. Run `juju status`:
```text

```

## Remove GCE setup

```{caution}
Do not forget to remove your test setup - it can be costly!
```

Check the list of currently running GCE instances:
```text
> gcloud compute instances list
NAME           ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
juju-a82dd9-0  us-east1-b  n1-highcpu-4                10.142.0.30  34.23.252.144  RUNNING
juju-e7c0db-2  us-east1-b  n2-highcpu-2                10.142.0.32  34.138.167.85  RUNNING
juju-e7c0db-3  us-east1-c  n2d-highcpu-2               10.142.0.34  34.23.202.220  RUNNING
juju-e7c0db-0  us-east1-d  n2-highcpu-2                10.142.0.31  34.148.44.51   RUNNING
```

Request Juju to clean all GCE resources:
```text
juju destroy-controller gce --no-prompt --force --destroy-all-models
```

Re-check that there are no running GCE instances left (it should be empty):
```text
gcloud compute instances list
```
