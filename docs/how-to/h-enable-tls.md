# How to enable TLS encryption

This guide will show how to enable TLS using the [`self-signed-certificates` operator](https://github.com/canonical/self-signed-certificates-operator) as an example. 

[note type="caution"]
**[Self-signed certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate) are not recommended for a production environment.**

Check [this guide](/t/11664) for an overview of the TLS certificate charms available.

## Summary
* Enable TLS
* Disable TLS
* Manage certificates
  * Check certificates in use
  * Update keys
---

## Enable TLS

First, deploy the TLS charm:
```shell
juju deploy self-signed-certificates
```

To enable TLS on `postgresql`, integrate the two applications:
```shell
juju integrate self-signed-certificates postgresql
```

## Disable TLS
You can disable TLS by removing the integration.
```shell
juju remove-relation self-signed-certificates postgresql
```

## Manage certificates
### Check certificates in use
To check the certificates in use by PostgreSQL, you can run:
```shell
openssl s_client -starttls postgres -connect <leader_unit_IP>:<port> | grep issuer
```

### Update keys
Updates to private keys for certificate signing requests (CSR) can be made via the `set-tls-private-key` action. Note that passing keys to external/internal keys should *only be done with* `base64 -w0`, *not* `cat`. 

With three replicas, this schema should be followed:

Generate a shared internal key:
```shell
openssl genrsa -out internal-key.pem 3072
```
Generate external keys for each unit:
```shell
openssl genrsa -out external-key-0.pem 3072
openssl genrsa -out external-key-1.pem 3072
openssl genrsa -out external-key-2.pem 3072
```

Apply both private keys to each unit. The shared internal key will be applied only to the juju leader.

```
juju run postgresql/0 set-tls-private-key "external-key=$(base64 -w0 external-key-0.pem)"  "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"  --wait
juju run postgresql/1 set-tls-private-key "external-key=$(base64 -w0 external-key-1.pem)"  "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"  --wait
juju run postgresql/2 set-tls-private-key "external-key=$(base64 -w0 external-key-2.pem)"  "internal-key=$(base64 -w0 internal-key.pem)"  --wait
```

Updates can also be done with auto-generated keys:

```
juju run postgresql/0 set-tls-private-key
juju run postgresql/1 set-tls-private-key
juju run postgresql/2 set-tls-private-key
```
