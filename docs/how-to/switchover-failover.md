# Switchover / failover

Charmed PostgreSQL constantly monitors the cluster status and performs **automated failover** in case of Primary unit gone. Sometimes **manual switchover** is necessary for hardware maintenance reasons. Check the difference between them [here](https://dbvisit.com/blog/difference-between-failover-vs-switchover).

[Manual switchover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchover) is possible using Juju action [promote-to-primary](https://charmhub.io/postgresql/actions#promote-to-primary). 

Charmed PostgreSQL has been designed for maximum guarantee of data survival in all corner cases. As such, allowed actions depend on the configured [Juju unit state](/explanation/units).

## Switchover 

To switchover the PostgreSQL Primary (write-endpoint) to new Juju unit, use Juju action `promote-to-primary` (on the unit `x`, which will be promoted as a new primary):

```text
juju run postgresql/x promote-to-primary scope=unit
```

Note that:
* a manual switchover is possible on the healthy '[Sync Standby](/explanation/units)' unit only. Otherwise it will be rejected by Patroni with the reason explanation.
* the [Juju leader](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/unit/#leader-unit) unit and PostgreSQL primary unit are normally pointing to different [Juju units](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/unit/). Juju leader failover is fully automated and can be [enforced](https://github.com/canonical/jhack?tab=readme-ov-file#elect) for educational purpose only! Do **not** trigger Juju leader election to move the primary.

## Failover

Charmed PostgreSQL doesn't provide manual failover due to lack of data safety guarantees.

Advanced users can still execute it using [patronictl](/reference/troubleshooting/cli-helpers) and [Patroni REST API](/reference/troubleshooting/cli-helpers). The same time Charmed PostgreSQL allows the cluster recovery using the full PostgreSQL/Patroni/Raft cluster re-initialization.

## Raft re-initialization

```{caution}
This is the worst possible recovery case scenario when Primary and ALL Sync Standby units lost simultaneously and their data cannot be recovered from the disc. 

In this case, Patroni cannot perform automatic failover for the only available Replica(s) units. Still Patroni provides the read-only access to the data.

A manual failover procedure cannot guarantee the latest SQL transactions' availability on the replica unit(s) due to the [lag distance](/explanation/units) to the primary. Additionally, Raft cluster consensus is not possible when one unit is left in a three-unit cluster. 
```

The command to re-initialize the Raft cluster should be executed when charm is ready:
* the last Juju unit is available in Juju application
* the last unit was has detected Raft majority lost, status: `Raft majority loss, run: promote-to-primary`

To re-initialize Raft and fix the Partition/PostgreSQL cluster (when requested):

```text
juju run postgresql/x promote-to-primary scope=unit force=true
```

Deploy PostgreSQL 3 units:

Find the current primary/standby/replica:

```text

Kill the leader and sync standby machines:

```text

At this stage it is recommended to restore the lost nodes, they will rejoin the cluster automatically once Juju detects their availability.

To start Raft re-initialization, remove DEAD machines as a signal to charm that they cannot be restored/started and no risks for split-brain:

```text
> juju remove-machine --force 0 
WARNING This command will perform the following actions:
will remove machine 0
- will remove unit postgresql/0
- will remove storage pgdata/0
Continue [y/N]? y

> juju remove-machine --force 2
WARNING This command will perform the following actions:
will remove machine 2
- will remove unit postgresql/2
- will remove storage pgdata/2
Continue [y/N]? y
```

Check the status to ensure `Raft majority loss`:

```text
> juju status
...
Unit           Workload  Agent      Machine  Public address  Ports     Message
postgresql/1*  blocked   executing  1        10.189.210.166  5432/tcp  Raft majority loss, run: promote-to-primary
...
```

Start Raft re-initialization:

```text
> juju run postgresql/1 promote-to-primary scope=unit force=true
```

Wait for re-initiation to be completed:

```
> juju status
...
Unit           Workload     Agent      Machine  Public address  Ports     Message
postgresql/1*  maintenance  executing  3        10.189.210.166  5432/tcp  (promote-to-primary) Reinitialising raft
...
```

At the end, the primary until is back:

```text

```

```text
> juju add-unit postgresql -n 2
```
