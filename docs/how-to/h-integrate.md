# How to integrate with another application

[Integrations](https://juju.is/docs/juju/relation) (formerly “relations”) are connections between two applications with compatible endpoints. These connections simplify the creation and management of users, passwords, and other shared data.

This guide shows how to integrate Charmed PostgreSQL with both charmed and non-charmed applications.

> For developer information about how to integrate your own charmed application with PostgreSQL, see [Development > How to integrate with your charm](/t/11865).

## Integrate with a charmed application

Integrations with charmed applications are supported via the modern [`postgresql_client`](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces/blob/main/interfaces/postgresql_client/v0/README.md) interface, and the legacy `psql` interface from the [original version](https://launchpad.net/postgresql-charm) of the charm.

> You can see which existing charms are compatible with PostgreSQL in the [Integrations](https://charmhub.io/postgresql/integrations) tab.

### Modern `postgresql_client` interface
To integrate with a charmed application that supports the `postgresql_client` interface, run
```shell
juju integrate postgresql:database <charm>
```

To remove the integration, run
```shell
juju remove-relation postgresql <charm>
```

### Legacy `pgsql` interface
[note type="caution"]
Note that this interface is **deprecated**.
See more information in [Explanation > Legacy charm](/t/10690).
[/note]

To integrate via the legacy interface, run
 ```shell
juju integrate postgresql:db <charm>
```

Extended permissions can be requested using the `db-admin` endpoint:
```shell
juju integrate postgresql:db-admin <charm>
```

## Integrate with a non-charmed application

To integrate with an application outside of Juju, you must use the [`data-integrator` charm](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator) to create the required credentials and endpoints.

Deploy `data-integrator`:
```shell
juju deploy data-integrator --config database-name=<name>
```

Integrate with PostgreSQL:
```shell
juju integrate data-integrator postgresql
```

Use the `get-credentials` action to retrieve credentials from `data-integrator`:
```shell
juju run data-integrator/leader get-credentials
```

## Rotate application passwords
To rotate the passwords of users created for integrated applications, the integration should be removed and integrated again. This process will generate a new user and password for the application.

```shell
juju remove-relation <charm> postgresql
juju integrate <charm> postgresql
```
>`<charm>` can be `data-integrator` in the case of connecting with a non-charmed application.

### Internal operator user
The operator user is used internally by the Charmed PostgreSQL application. The `set-password` action can be used to rotate its password.

To set a specific password for the operator user, run
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader set-password password=<password>
```

To randomly generate a password for the `operator` user, run
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader set-password
```
