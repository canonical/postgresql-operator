# How to create and list backups

This guide contains recommended steps and useful commands for creating and managing backups to ensure smooth restores.

## Prerequisites
* A cluster with at [least three nodes](/t/charmed-postgresql-how-to-manage-units/9689?channel=14/stable) deployed
* Access to S3 storage
* [Configured settings for S3 storage](/t/charmed-postgresql-how-to-configure-s3/9681?channel=14/stable)

## Summary
- [Save your current cluster credentials](#heading--save-credentials), as you'll need them for restoring
- [Create a backup](#heading--create-backup) 
- [List backups](#heading--list-backups) to check the availability and status of your backups

For security reasons, charm credentials are not stored inside backups. So, if you plan to restore to a backup at any point in the future, **you will need the `operator`, `replication`, and `rewind` user passwords for your existing cluster**.

You can retrieve them with:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader get-password username=operator
juju run postgresql/leader get-password username=replication
juju run postgresql/leader get-password username=rewind
``` 
For more context about passwords during a restore, check [How to migrate a cluster > Manage cluster passwords](/t/9691#heading--manage-cluster-passwords).

<a href="#heading--create-backup"><h2 id="heading--create-backup">Create a backup</h2></a>
Once you have a three-node cluster with configurations set for S3 storage, check that Charmed PostgreSQL is `active` and `idle` with `juju status`. 

Once Charmed PostgreSQL is `active` and `idle`, you can create your first backup with the `create-backup` command:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader create-backup
```
By default, backups created with command above will be **full** backups: a copy of *all* your data will be stored in S3. There are 2 other supported types of backups (available in revision 416+, currently in channel `14/edge` only):
* Differential: Only modified files since the last full backup will be stored.
* Incremental: Only modified files since the last successful backup (of any type) will be stored.

To specify the desired backup type, use the [`type`](https://charmhub.io/postgresql/actions?channel=14/edge#create-backup) parameter:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader create-backup type={full|differential|incremental}
```

**Tip**: To avoid unnecessary service downtime, always use non-primary units for the action `create-backup`. Keep in mind that:
* TLS enabled:  disables the command from running on *primary units*.
* TLS **not** enabled: disables the command from running on *non-primary units*.

<a href="#heading--list-backups"><h2 id="heading--list-backups">List backups</h2></a>
You can list your available, failed, and in progress backups by running the `list-backups` command:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader list-backups
```
