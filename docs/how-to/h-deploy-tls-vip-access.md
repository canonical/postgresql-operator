# Deploy for external TLS VIP access

This guide goes over an example deployment of PostgreSQL, PgBouncer and HAcluster that require external TLS/SSL access via [Virtual IP (VIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_IP_address).   

It combines the following guides, where you can find more detailed information:
* [PostgreSQL | Tutorial > Enable TLS](/t/9699)
* [PostgreSQL | How to connect from outside the local network](/t/15802)
* [PgBouncer | How to connect from outside the local network](https://charmhub.io/pgbouncer/docs/h-external-access?channel=1/stable)

## Requirements

Although Canonical does not prescribe how you should set up your environment, we can provide recommendations. Consider [contacting us](/t/11863) for support with your use-case.

The basic requirements to follow along with this example setup are the following:

* A fully deployed and running Juju machine environment
  * See the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](/t/9709) for a quick setup with Multipass
  * See the official [Juju deployment guide](https://juju.is/docs/juju/tutorial#deploy) for more details
* A spare virtual IP address for [hacluster](/t/15741?channel=1/stable#using-a-virtual-ip-to-connect-to-pgbouncer)
  * See the PgBouncer guide: [How to use a VIP to connect to PgBouncer](https://charmhub.io/pgbouncer/docs/h-external-access?channel=1/stable)
* DNS record pointing to VIP above (`my-tls-example-db.local` is used as an example here)

## Design

[note type=caution]
This setup applicable for VM/machine charms only. **Do NOT use it for K8s deployments!**
[/note]

![PostgreSQL TLS VIP|631x562](upload://fIN24xhTTX1Hy1aszs7Os413Y0m.png)

This setup deploys the following components:

* The [`postgresql`](https://charmhub.io/postgresql) charm (3 units, as a single cluster).
* The [`self-signed-certificates`](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates) charm as the TLS provider. 
  * Note that this is not suitable for production deployments. See the guide: [Security with X.509 certificates](https://charmhub.io/topics/security-with-x-509-certificates).
* The [`data-integrator`](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator) charm as a [principal](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charm-taxonomy#heading--principal-charms) charm for the [subordinated](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charm-taxonomy#heading--subordinate-charms) charms below (3 units for high availability):
  * The latest [`pgbouncer`](https://charmhub.io/pgbouncer?channel=1/stable) charm as a load-balancer and connection pooler (3 units).
  * The [`hacluster`](https://charmhub.io/hacluster) charm for VIP handling (3 units are the minimum for HA).
  * (optional) The COS [`grafana-agent`](https://charmhub.io/grafana-agent) charm for `Monitoring` purposes.

## Deploy components

Create a Juju model if you haven't already:
```shell
juju add-model my-external-tls-db
```
Deploy `postgresql` and `self-signed-certificates`:
```shell
juju deploy postgresql -n 3
juju deploy self-signed-certificates
juju integrate postgresql self-signed-certificates
```
Deploy `pgbouncer` from the `1/stable` channel and configure it with your VIP:
```shell
juju deploy pgbouncer --channel 1/stable --config vip=10.20.30.40
juju integrate pgbouncer postgresql
juju integrate pgbouncer self-signed-certificates
```
Deploy `data-integrator` with 3 units and configure the database name of your choice. In this example, we use `mytestdb`:
```shell
juju deploy data-integrator -n 3 --config database-name=mytestdb
juju integrate data-integrator pgbouncer
```
Deploy `hacluster`:
```shell
juju deploy hacluster
juju integrate hacluster pgbouncer
juju integrate hacluster:juju-info data-integrator
```

Example `juju status` output:
```shell

## Check connectivity

To test the connection to PostgreSQL via TLS, first get the credentials via `data-integrator`:
```shell
juju run data-integrator/leader get-credentials
```
```shell

  subordinated: "true"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  uris: postgresql://relation_id_9:V7kHqHyapIphkUS0cHoOtP3j@10.78.217.100:6432/mytestdb                                                                                                                                                                 
  username: relation_id_9                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  version: "14.12"     
```

Now use the received credentials (`uris`) to connect PostgreSQL (via TLS/SSL):
```shell
> psql postgresql://relation_id_9:V7kHqHyapIphkUS0cHoOtP3j@10.78.217.100:6432/mytestdb
psql (14.15 (Ubuntu 14.15-0ubuntu0.22.04.1), server 14.12 (Ubuntu 14.12-0ubuntu0.22.04.1))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

mytestdb=> select now();
              now              
-------------------------------
 2025-01-14 11:51:04.646245+00
(1 row)
```
Ensure your DNS records points to the virtual IP and that it is routable/reachable from outside of your network to connect using DNS:
```shell
psql postgresql://relation_id_9:V7kHqHyapIphkUS0cHoOtP3j@my-tls-example-db.local:6432/mytestdb
```

## (Optional) Add monitoring

Consider adding the [Canonical Observability Stack (COS)](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack) to your setup for monitoring, alert rules, logs, and tracing.

>See: [PostgreSQL | How to enable monitoring](/t/10600), [PgBouncer | How to enable monitoring](/t/12308).

## High availability
[note type=caution]
In production environments, deploy different units into separate availability zones (AZ).

See: [How to deploy > Multi-AZ](/t/15749)
[/note]

At this point, Juju is responsible for the health of the clusters/applications:
* The PostgreSQL charm will restart the workload if PostgreSQL is not healthy.
* The Juju agent will restart the unit/vm/container if it is no longer reachable/healthy (in the same AZ).
* The Juju controller will make sure Juju agent is up and running and charm is healthy.
* The HACluster charm will make sure the VIP is always reachable and routes to a single PgBouncer.
* PgBouncer will balance incoming connections and makes sure write traffic goes to the primary PostgreSQL unit.
* The TLS operator (in this example, the `self-signed-certificates` charm) is responsible for providing all components with signed ready-to-use TLS artifacts.
