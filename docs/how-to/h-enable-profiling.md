# Enable profiling with Parca

This guide contains the steps to enable profiling with [Parca](https://www.parca.dev/docs/overview/) for your PostgreSQL application. 

## Summary
* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Set up the Parca backend](#set-up-the-parca-backend)
  * [Charmed Parca K8s](#charmed-parca-k8s)
  * [Polar Signals Cloud](#polar-signals-cloud)
* [View profiles](#view-profiles)

---

## Prerequisites

[note type=caution]
**Do not skip this section** if you are deploying PostgreSQL in an LXD model or if your base is `ubuntu@22.04`.
[/note]


This guide assumes you already have a juju model with Charmed PostgreSQL deployed.

> See: [How to deploy PostgreSQL](/t/16811)

In order for your Charmed PostgreSQL deployment to be correctly set up for integration with Parca, there are two important considerations: 
* [LXD virtualization type](#lxd-virtualization-type)
* [Base (Ubuntu version)](#base-ubuntu-version)

### LXD virtualization type

**If you are deploying Charmed PostgreSQL in a LXD model, you will need to ensure that LXD's virtualization type is set to `virtual-machine` for the Juju application.**

This is because LXD does not allow `/sys/kernel/tracing` to be mounted in a system container (even in privileged mode) due to security isolation concerns. 

To ensure that a virtual machine is used instead of a system container, you would need to add constraints, for example:
```
juju deploy postgresql --constraints="virt-type=virtual-machine"`. 
```

### Base (Ubuntu version)
**If your base is `ubuntu@22.04`, you will need to ensure that your are using the `generic` flavor of Linux.**
>  See the output of `uname -r` to confirm. 

If you do not have the `generic` flavor, you can enable it on a unit to be profiled as follows:

```
juju ssh postgresql/0 bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-image-virtual
sudo apt-get autopurge linux-image-kvm
```

If your application is deployed in an LXD model, run the following command:
```
rm /etc/default/grub.d/40-force-partuuid.cfg
```

Open the `/etc/default/grub` file  with your editor of choice and replace the line that starts with `GRUB_DEFAULT=` with:
```
release=$(linux-version list | grep -e '-generic$' | sort -V | tail -n1)
GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux $release"
```

Exit out of the `/etc/default/grub file`, update GRUB, and reboot:
```
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```

Nothing needs to be done if the base is `ubuntu@24.04`, which already loads the kernel symbol table for debugging by default.

## Set up the Parca backend

There are two potential backends:
* [Charmed Parca K8s](#charmed-parca-k8s) (requires COS and cross-model integrations)
* [Polar Signals Cloud](#polar-signals-cloud) (COS is optional)

### Charmed Parca K8s

This section goes through the steps for enabling profiling with Charmed Parca K8s as the backend.

#### 1. Deploy `cos-lite` and `parca-k8s`

Refer to [Getting started on MicroK8s](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s) and deploy the `cos-lite` bundle from the `latest/edge` track in a Kubernetes environment.

Then, refer to [Deploy Charmed Parca on top of COS-lite](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/how-to-deploy-charmed-parca-on-top-of-cos-lite/16579) to deploy Charmed Parca K8s in the same model as the `cos-lite` bundle.

#### 2. Offer interfaces

Offer interfaces for cross-model integrations:

```
juju offer <parca_k8s_application_name>:parca-store-endpoint
```

#### 3. Deploy and integrate `parca-agent` with `postgresql`

Switch to the model containing the Charmed PostgreSQL deployment, deploy Charmed Parca Agent, and integrate it with Charmed PostgreSQL:

```
juju switch <machine_controller_name>:<postgresql_model_name>

juju deploy parca-agent --channel latest/edge
juju integrate postgresql parca-agent
```

#### 4. Integrate `parca-agent` with `parca-k8s`

Consume the parca offer from [Step 2](#2-offer-interfaces) and integrate with them:

```
juju find-offers <k8s_controller_name>:
```

> :exclamation: Do not miss the colon "`:`" in the command above.

Below is a sample output where `k8s` is the K8s controller name and `cos` is the model where `cos-lite` and `parca-k8s` are deployed:

```
Store  URL                            Access  Interfaces
k8s    admin/cos.parca                admin   parca_store:parca-store-endpoint
```

Next, consume this offer so that is reachable from the current machine model: 

```
juju consume k8s:admin/cos.parca
```

Finally, relate Charmed Parca Agent with the consumed offer endpoint:
```
juju integrate parca-agent parca 
```

### Polar Signals Cloud

This section goes through the steps for enabling profiling with Polar Signals Cloud (PSC) as the backend. 

[note]
With PSC, `cos-lite` and `parca-k8s` are not required. This section goes through the recommended setup, where `polar-signals-cloud-integrator` is deployed in the same model as `postgresql`, and `parca-agent` is used to relay traffic to PSC.

If you would like to use `parca-k8s` to relay traffic to PSC instead, refer to [Steps 1 and 2](#1-deploy-cos-lite-and-parca-k8s) in the Charmed Parca K8s section.
[/note]

#### 1. Deploy and integrate `parca-agent` with `postgresql`

In the machine model where PostgreSQL is deployed, deploy `parca-agent` and integrate it with `postgresql`:

```
juju deploy parca-agent --channel latest/edge
juju integrate postgresql parca-agent
```

#### 2. Integrate `parca-agent` with `polar-signals-cloud-integrator`

Follow the guide [How to integrate with Polar Signals Cloud](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/charmed-parca-docs-how-to-integrate-with-polar-signals-cloud/16559).


## View profiles 

After the backend setup is complete, the profiles for the machines where the PostgreSQL units are running will be accessible from the Parca web interface. 

If you are running Charmed Parca K8s, you can also access the link for Parca's web interface from COS catalogue (`juju run traefik/0 show-proxied-endpoints` in the K8s model where `cos-lite` is deployed).

Furthermore, if you have `cos-lite` deployed, you can use Grafana to explore profiles under the `Explore` section with `parca-k8s` as the data source.
