# Deploy on Juju spaces

The Charmed PostgreSQL operator supports [Juju spaces](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/space/index.html) to separate network traffic for:
- **Client** - PostgreSQL instance to client data
- **Instance-replication** - cluster instances replication data
- **Cluster-replication** - cluster to cluster replication data
- **Backup** - backup and restore data

## Prerequisites

* Charmed PostgreSQL 16
* Configured network spaces
  * See [Juju | How to manage network spaces](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/latest/reference/juju-cli/list-of-juju-cli-commands/add-space/)

## Deploy

On application deployment, constraints are required to ensure the unit(s) have address(es) on the specified network space(s), and endpoint binding(s) for the space(s).

For example, with spaces configured for instance replication and client traffic:
```text
‚ùØ juju spaces
Name      Space ID  Subnets
alpha     0         10.163.154.0/24
client    1         10.0.0.0/24
peers     2         10.10.10.0/24
```

The space `alpha` is default and cannot be removed. To deploy Charmed PostgreSQL Operator using the spaces:
```text
juju deploy postgresql --channel 16/edge \
  --constraints spaces=client,peers \
  --bind "database-peers=peers database=client"
```

```{caution}
Currently there's no support for the juju  `bind` command. Network space binding must be defined at deploy time only.
```

Consequently, a client application must use the `client` space on the model, or a space for the same subnet in another model, for example:
```text
juju deploy client-app \
  --constraints spaces=client \
  --bind database=client
```

The two application can be then related using:
```text
juju integrate postgresql:database client-app:database
```

The client application will receive network endpoints on the `10.0.0.0/24` subnet.

The Charmed PostgreSQL operator endpoints are:

| Endpoint                       | Traffic              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| database                       | Client               |
| database-peers                 | Instance-replication |
| replication-offer, replication | Cluster-replication  |
| s3-parameters                  | Backup               |


```{note}
If using a network space for the backup traffic, the user is responsible for ensuring that the target object storage URL traffic is routed via the specified network space.
```
