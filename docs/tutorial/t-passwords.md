# Manage passwords

When we accessed PostgreSQL earlier in this tutorial, we needed to use a password manually. Passwords help to secure our database and are essential for security. Over time, it is a good practice to change the password frequently. 

In this section, we will go through setting and changing the password for the admin user.

## Summary

  - ...for another user

<a href="#heading--retrieve-password"><h2 id="heading--retrieve-password"> Retrieve the operator password </h2></a>

The operator's password can be retrieved by running the `get-password` action on the Charmed PostgreSQL VM application:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader get-password
```
Running the command should output:
```yaml
unit-postgresql-0:
  UnitId: postgresql/0
  id: "14"
  results:
    operator-password: eItxBiOYeMf7seSv
  status: completed
  timing:
    completed: 2023-03-20 09:17:51 +0000 UTC
    enqueued: 2023-03-20 09:17:49 +0000 UTC
    started: 2023-03-20 09:17:50 +0000 UTC
```

<a href="#heading--rotate-password"><h2 id="heading--rotate-password"> Rotate the operator password </h2></a>

You can change the operator's password to a new random password by entering:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader set-password
```
Running the command should output:
```yaml
unit-postgresql-0:
  UnitId: postgresql/0
  id: "16"
  results:
    operator-password: npGdNGNGVtu7SO50
  status: completed
  timing:
    completed: 2023-03-20 09:18:11 +0000 UTC
    enqueued: 2023-03-20 09:18:08 +0000 UTC
    started: 2023-03-20 09:18:10 +0000 UTC
```
The `status: completed` element in the output above indicates that the password has been successfully updated. The new password should be different from the previous password.

<a href="#heading--set-new-password"><h2 id="heading--set-new-password"> Set a new password </h2></a>

You can set a specific password for any user by running the `set-password` juju action on the leader unit.   

### ...for the operator user
To set a manual password for the operator/admin user, run the following command:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader set-password password=<password>
```
where `<password>` is your password of choice.

Example output:
```yaml
unit-postgresql-0:
  UnitId: postgresql/0
  id: "18"
  results:
    operator-password: my-password
  status: completed
  timing:
    completed: 2023-03-20 09:20:06 +0000 UTC
    enqueued: 2023-03-20 09:20:04 +0000 UTC
    started: 2023-03-20 09:20:05 +0000 UTC
```

### ...for another user
To set a manual password for another user, run the following command:
```shell
juju run postgresql/leader set-password username=my-user password=my-password
```
