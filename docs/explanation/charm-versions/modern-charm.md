# Modern PostgreSQL charm

Modern PostgreSQL charms are [Ops charms] released in the Charmhub channels `14/` (PostgreSQL 14) and `16/` (PostgreSQL 16). 

They provide the `database` endpoint for the `postgresql_client` interface.

PostgreSQL 14 (track `14/`) provides `db` and `db-admin` endpoints for the legacy `pgsql` interface, and supports migration from the legacy charm.

PostgreSQL 16 (track `16/`) does not provide any legacy interfaces and does not support migration.

## Configuration options

The legacy charm config options were not moved to the modern charms. Modern charms apply the best possible configuration automatically. 

Feel free to [contact us](/reference/contacts) about the database tuning and configuration options.

## Extensions supported by modern charm

The legacy charm provided plugins/extensions enabling through the relation (interface `pgsql`).This is NOT supported by modern charms (neither `pgsql` nor `postgresql_client` interfaces). Please enable the necessary extensions using appropriate `plugin_*_enable` [config option](https://charmhub.io/postgresql/configure) of the modern charm. After enabling the modern charm, it will provide plugins support for both `pgsql` (only if it's PostgreSQL 14) and `postgresql_client` interfaces.

See: [](/reference/plugins-extensions)

Feel free to [contact us](/reference/contacts) if there is a particular extension you are interested in.

## Roles supported by modern charm

In the legacy charm, the user could request roles by setting the `roles` field to a comma separated list of desired roles. This is NOT supported by the `14/` modern charm implementation of the legacy `pgsql` interface. 

The same functionality is provided via the modern `postgresql_client` using [extra-user-roles](/explanation/users). 

For more information about migrating the new interface on PostgreSQL 14, see [How to integrate PostgreSQL with your charm](https://canonical-charmed-postgresql.readthedocs-hosted.com/14/how-to/development/integrate-with-your-charm/).

## Workload artifacts

The legacy charm used to deploy PostgreSQL from APT/Debian packages,
while the modern charm installs and operates PostgreSQL snap [charmed-postgresql](https://snapcraft.io/charmed-postgresql). 

See: [](explanation/architecture).
