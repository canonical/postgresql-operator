# Releases

This page provides high-level overviews of the dependencies and features that are supported by each revision in every stable release.

To learn more about the different release tracks and channels, see the [Juju documentation about channels](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/charm/#risk).

To see all releases and commits, check the [Charmed PostgreSQL Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-operator/releases).

## Dependencies and supported features

For a given release, this table shows:
* The PostgreSQL version packaged inside.
* The minimum Juju 3 version required to reliably operate **all** features of the release
* Support for specific features

| Release | PostgreSQL version | Minimum Juju version | [TLS encryption](/how-to/enable-tls) | [COS monitoring](/how-to/monitoring-cos/enable-monitoring) | [Minor version upgrades](/how-to/upgrade/index) | [Cross-regional async replication](/how-to/cross-regional-async-replication/index) | [Point-in-time recovery](/how-to/back-up-and-restore/restore-a-backup) |

## Architecture and base

Several [revisions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/charm/#charm-revision) are released simultaneously for different [bases/series](https://juju.is/docs/juju/base) using the same charm code. In other words, one release contains multiple revisions.

If you do not specify a revision on deploy time, Juju will automatically choose the revision that matches your base and architecture.

```{caution}
If you deploy with the `--revision` flag, **you must make sure the revision matches your base and architecture**. 

Check the tables below, or use [`juju info`](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-info).
```

## Plugins/extensions

For a list of all plugins supported for each revision, see the reference page [Plugins/extensions](/reference/plugins-extensions).
