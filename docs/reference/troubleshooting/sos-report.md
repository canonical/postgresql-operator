You can use the [built-in version of SoS](#use-built-in-sos-recommended), or [retrieve the latest version from GitHub](#use-the-latest-sos-plugins-from-git). 

```{caution}

```

## Use built-in SoS (recommended)

Charmed PostgreSQL shipped with built-in [SoS](https://github.com/sosreport/sos) reporting tool. You can use it to collect logs on a specific unit or multiple units at once.

### Collect logs on one unit

To generate the troubleshooting report archiving all logs simply call `sos report` inside the relevant Juju unit:
```text
juju ssh postgresql/0
> sudo sos report -o system,systemd,snap,charmed_postgresql --low-priority
```
As a result, the archive will all logs will be generated and can be shared with your support representative:
```text
...
Your sos report has been generated and saved in:
	/tmp/sosreport-juju-d4c067-1-2025-04-07-chdmwlz.tar.xz

...
```

Use `juju scp` to copy logs from Juju unit to localhost:
```text
juju scp postgresql/0:/tmp/sosreport-juju-d4c067-1-2025-04-07-chdmwlz.tar.xz .
```

### Collect logs from several units

The sos tool allows you to collect logs from several Juju units (replace <UNIT_A/B/...> labels with proper Juju unit like `postgresql/0`).

Run the following command from outside the Juju units:
```text
sos collect --cluster-type juju --no-local -c "juju.units=<UNIT_A>,<UNIT_B>,<...>" --batch -o system,systemd,snap,charmed_postgresql --low-priority
```

## Use the latest sos plugins from Git

The latest version of [sos plugins](https://github.com/sosreport/sos/tree/main/sos/report/plugins) can be retrieved from Git easily:
```text
git clone https://github.com/sosreport/sos.git
cd sos
sudo ./bin/sos report -Â­a
```

The output will be the same to the example above providing archive with all logs as above:
```text
Your sos report has been generated and saved in:
	/tmp/sosreport-juju-d4c067-1-2025-04-07-egosqmi.tar.xz
```
