## Hardware

Make sure your machine meets the following requirements:

* 8GB of RAM.
* 2 CPU threads.
* At least 20GB of available storage.

The charm is based on the [charmed-postgresql snap](https://snapcraft.io/charmed-postgresql). It currently supports:
* `amd64`
* `arm64` (from revision 396+)

[Contact us](/t/11863) if you are interested in a new architecture!

## Networking
* Access to the internet is required for downloading required snaps and charms
* Only IPv4 is supported at the moment
