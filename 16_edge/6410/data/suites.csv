"Force leader change and restart to trigger the library fix code path.

    This test properly validates the fix from
    https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-single-kernel-library/pull/54 by:
    1. Finding the current Juju leader
    2. Killing the leader's juju agent to force leader election
    3. Waiting for a new leader to be elected
    4. Restarting the new leader's LXD machine
    5. Verifying the log message appears confirming the fix handled persistent temp storage

    This scenario triggers set_up_database() on the new leader during the start event,
    which should detect the persistent temp storage and log the appropriate message.
