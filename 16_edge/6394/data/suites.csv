"Verifies that database units with attached storage correctly repurpose storage.

    It is not enough to verify that Juju attaches the storage. Hence test checks that the
    postgresql properly uses the storage that was provided. (ie. doesn't just re-sync everything
    from primary, but instead computes a diff between current storage and primary storage.)

"Force leader change and restart to trigger the library fix code path.

    This test properly validates the fix from
    https://github.com/canonical/postgresql-single-kernel-library/pull/54 by:
    1. Finding the current Juju leader
    2. Killing the leader's juju agent to force leader election
    3. Waiting for a new leader to be elected
    4. Restarting the new leader's LXD machine
    5. Verifying the log message appears confirming the fix handled persistent temp storage

    This scenario triggers set_up_database() on the new leader during the start event,
    which should detect the persistent temp storage and log the appropriate message.
