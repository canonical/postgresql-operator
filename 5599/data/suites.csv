"Verifies that database units with attached storage correctly repurpose storage.

    It is not enough to verify that Juju attaches the storage. Hence test checks that the
    postgresql properly uses the storage that was provided. (ie. doesn't just re-sync everything
    from primary, but instead computes a diff between current storage and primary storage.)
